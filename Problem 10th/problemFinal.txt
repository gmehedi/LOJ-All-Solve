You are given an integer number is called n and n integer numbers like as Ai, Ai+1, Ai+2, An-1, ( 0 <= i < n).
You should append the n integer numbers in such a way that After appending the resulting number should be maximum as large as possible.
Like as...
You are given n = 4 numbers such as 9, 11, 3, 29. You can append them many ways.Some possible ways are.....

911329 
931129
929311
932911
etc...
......

But the maximum number should be 4th way that is 932911. So the sequence should be
9 then,
3 then,
29 then,
11

After builting the serial of those integers, You should take 3 integer numbers from them, they are first number [ from index = 0 ] , middle number [ from index = floor( n/2 ) ] and
last number [ from index = n-1 ].

For this example, we should take 9 [ from index = 0 ], 29 [ from index = n/2 = 4/2 = 2 ], and 11 [ from index = n-1 = 3 ].

Then take the maximum and minimum number from this 3 integers that means 9, 29, 11. So maximum number = 29 and minimum number = 9.

Finally you should print the result of Xor ( ^ ) operation of interval minimum number to maximum number.
That means....
9 ^ 10 ^ 11 ^ 12 ^ 13 ........... ..... ... .. . ^29 = 9.
So the result is 9.

We hear, you are good programmer of BUBT.So we request you to solve this problem.


Input:
Take an integer number n, Indicate the number of integers. Then take n integer numbers Ai , Ai+1, Ai+2....An-1. ( 0 <= i < n ).

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= Ai <= 10^12

Output:
You should print the result of Xor ( ^ ) operation of interval minimum number to maximum number with above condition.

Test Case:

input:

4
9 11 3 29

output:

9
